"""

Differentiate between append () and extend () methods? 


Python append() method adds an element to a list, and the extend() method concatenates the first list
with another list (or another iterable). When append() method adds its arguments 
as a single element to the end of a list,the length of the list itself will increase by one. 
Whereas extend() method iterates over its argument adding each element to the list, extending the list. 
The length of the list will increase by however many elements were in the iterable argument.
