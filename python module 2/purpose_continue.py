
# What is the purpose continue statement in python? 

===> the continue statement is used to skip the rest
of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only.
loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration  

It returns the control to the beginning of the while loop.. 
The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in 
the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.
The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops.
