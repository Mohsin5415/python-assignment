# What are negative indexes and why are they used

==> index's are used in arrays in all programming languages.
we can access the elements of an array by going through their indexs.
but no programming language allows us to use negative index value such 
as -4.python programming language supports negative indexing of arrays, 
which is not available in arrays in most other programming languages.
this means that the negative index value of -1 gives the last element 
and -2 gives the second last element of an array.the negative indexing starts from where the array ends.
this means that the last element of the array is the first element in the negative indexing which is -1.
